# hello-world
my first repository


Hello, everyone!

I've been coding independently for a few years now, but I never studied it long enough to really know it or make any decent programs or websites. I dabbled a bit in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C++. I also used a few sites like Codeacademy and SoloLearn. I'd like to use GitHub as a resource to help improve my coding skills and help others improve.
